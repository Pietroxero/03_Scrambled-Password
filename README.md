# 03_Scrambled-Password

## Description
The purpose of this Challenge is to work with Javascript. We were to finish building out a function in the JS file that would generate a password within the text box of the HTML page that would be a random (Scrambled) password. There was a set of criteria that would be required for used to input within a series of prompts. This criteria ranged from Lower/Upper case letters, Numbers, Special Characters. Along with the following criteria, the password also had to be between 8 to 128 characters long.
